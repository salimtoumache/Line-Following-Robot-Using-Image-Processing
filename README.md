# Line-Following-Robot-Using-Image-Processing
A line following robot is automated device programmed to follow specific path. Some of existing techniques used in controlling line following robot are by IR sensor, LDR sensors, etc. This research work aims to develop image processing-based line following robot. A camera is used to obtain image of track and then it is converted into bitmap image. Least Square Method is used to follow the predefined path. By calculating slope of line, angle by which robot should turn is determined. Thus, by using image processing technique line following robot is guided along the desired path
